Hi! This game is based off of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> but aims to make it much more needlesly complicated. 

Your goal is to be like the Clockwork version of a God, basically setting things in motion and hoping it'll all work out.

It's still very much a work in progress, but you can check out the latest version in a playable form here:
